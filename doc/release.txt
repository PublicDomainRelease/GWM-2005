                           MF2005_GWM Release Notes

     This file describes changes introduced into MF2005_GWM with each
official release.

Version 1.0.1; 8 August 2008
	Add modification to MF2005_GWM main program to pass HDRY to 
		GWM...OS routines. 

	Add changes in GWM1RMS2OS and GWM1HDC2OS that accept the passed 
		value of HDRY rather than accessing through BCFMODULE.

	Change in GWM1RMS2OT to write a line to the GWMWFILE even if the 
		flow rate for the well is zero.

	Add code to read IRM when SOLNTYP is 'NS' on line 2c of SOLN file 
		after read of RMNAME.  IRM is set to either 1, indicating
		that RMNAME is opened as UNFORMATTED or 3 indicating a 	
		FORMATTED write of the response matrix.  If IRM is blank,
		it is assigned a value of 1.  

	Add a subroutine CUTCOM in GWM1BAS2 that removes trailing comments 
		on an input line.  Insert calls to this routine in GWM1DCV2AR 
		and GWM1RMS2AR.

	Change the PCG file for test problems to account for new input 
		requirements.


Version 1.0; 12 August 2007 
	MF2005_GWM draws from a new set of GWM Package files.  These files
		were created in August 2007 and numbered as Package version 2.  
		The files were constructed from the Package files from MF2K_GWM 
		V1.1.1.  In most cases, only the name of the subroutine was 
		changed to indicate version 2, with no changes to the code.  
		In these cases, the version date was unchanged from MF2K_GWM 
		V1.1.1.   The package version date was changed.   Some 
		subroutines were functionally changed and new subroutines 
		were added in the GWM BAS package.  These changes are described 
		in the documentation for MF2005_GWM V1.0

	This version is the initial release.
