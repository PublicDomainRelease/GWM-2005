                           GWM-2005 Release Notes

     This file describes changes introduced into GWM-2005 with each
official release.

Version 1.2; 7 December 2009
	MF2005-GWM is renamed GWM-2005. 

	Add capability to accomodate problems on multipe grids using 
		MODFLOW-LGR. Build main program from MODFLOW-LGR Version 1.1.02 

	GWM-2005 Packages are revised to allow use of MODFLOW-LGR.  All 
		GWM-2005 package files are renumbered to Package version 3.

        Add CRITMFC input parameter which indicates how GWM will test 
                acceptability of the GWF process result.   CRITMFC is read in 
                GWM1RMS3AR and is used in GWM1BAS3AP.  The main program was also 
                modified to accommodate two metrics for acceptability.

        Add code in anticipation of a future version of GWM-2005 with parallel 
                programming capability.  Changes made in DCV, DCC, RMS, BAS, HDC 
                and STC Packages and main program of GWM.  These changes have 
                no impact on runs of the current verion of GWM-2005.  

        New report issued to document LGR capability and other changes:

                A Groundwater-Management Process for MODFLOW-2005 with Local 
                Grid Refinement (LGR) capability: U.S. Geological Survey 
                Techniques and Methods, 6-A33, 65 p.


============ Prior versions were named MF2005-GWM ==========================

Version 1.1; 8 June 2009
	Correct an output bug that caused incorrect values of the external 
		and binary variables to be used when writing the output file 
		for the base runs when the SLP option is used.  Changes made 
		in GWM1RMS3OT and GWM1SMC3OT.

	Simplify code arrangement in GWM1SMC3OT and GWM1OBJ3FM without changing
		 any functionality.

	Correct a bug that might allow referencing of an array beyond its 
		bound in loop 120 of SGWM1RMS3AP.

	Add a continuation line feature for BVLIST in GWM1DCV3AR so that 
		multiple lines can be read if the preceding line ends with &.

	Correct bug in GWM1PSIMPLEX1 that caused an incorrect count on the 
		number of slack variables passed to the LP solver for the case 
		when a summation constraint contains binary variables and is 
		specified as an equality constraint.

	Add code to GWM1PSIMPLEX1 to set relaxed binary variables to zero 
		if they are implicitly fixed by constraints that only contain 
		binary variables and that are already binding.  

	Add to the STC package the capability to process streamflow constraints
		represented by either the STR or SFR packages.  Create new 
		subroutine GWM1STC2OS2.  Impose requirement that both 
		STR and SFT packages can not be active in the flow process.


Version 1.0.1; 8 August 2008
	Add modification to MF2005_GWM main program to pass HDRY to 
		GWM...OS routines. 

	Add changes in GWM1RMS2OS and GWM1HDC2OS that accept the passed 
		value of HDRY rather than accessing through BCFMODULE.

	Change in GWM1RMS2OT to write a line to the GWMWFILE even if the 
		flow rate for the well is zero.

	Add code to read IRM when SOLNTYP is 'NS' on line 2c of SOLN file 
		after read of RMNAME.  IRM is set to either 1, indicating
		that RMNAME is opened as UNFORMATTED or 3 indicating a 	
		FORMATTED write of the response matrix.  If IRM is blank,
		it is assigned a value of 1.  

	Add a subroutine CUTCOM in GWM1BAS2 that removes trailing comments 
		on an input line.  Insert calls to this routine in GWM1DCV2AR 
		and GWM1RMS2AR.

	Change the PCG file for test problems to account for new input 
		requirements.


Version 1.0; 12 August 2007 
	MF2005_GWM draws from a new set of GWM Package files.  These files
		were created in August 2007 and numbered as Package version 2.  
		The files were constructed from the Package files from MF2K_GWM 
		V1.1.1.  In most cases, only the name of the subroutine was 
		changed to indicate version 2, with no changes to the code.  
		In these cases, the version date was unchanged from MF2K_GWM 
		V1.1.1.   The package version date was changed.   Some 
		subroutines were functionally changed and new subroutines 
		were added in the GWM BAS package.  These changes are described 
		in the documentation for MF2005_GWM V1.0

	This version is the initial release.
